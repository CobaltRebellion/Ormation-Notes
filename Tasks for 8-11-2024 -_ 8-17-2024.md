# Formal plan
Read the following chapters, and do the exercises as you finish the corresponding chapter.

Chapters to read:
- Chapter 4
	- Skip 4.3 unless you would like some more practice with pseudocode.
	- Skip 4.5 unless you are uncomfortable with `if` statements.
	- Skip everything in 4.6 except section 4.6.4. This section goes over conditional operators which are a nice shorthand.
	- Skip 4.7
	- Skip 4.8 unless you are uncomfortable with `while` loops.
- Chapter 5
	- Skip 5.3 if you are comfortable with `for` loops.
	- Skip 5.5 unless you want some concrete examples of using `for` loops.
	- Skip 5.7 unless you want some C++ examples.
	- Skim 5.13. Great section for learning how to visualize program control flow.
- Chapter 6
	- Skip 6.6. I don't expect you to memorize which libraries do what. You will always just Google search for them as you need them.
	- Skip 6.7
	- Skip 6.8
	- Skip 6.19 if you are comfortable with recursion.

Exercises in the book to do:
- Chapter 4
	- 4.13 -> 4.16: Great problems that have you go through the process of designing and implementing algorithms.
	- 4.23 -> 4.25: Exposes you to the dangling else problem, which will teach you some good practices when working with conditionals.
	- 4.27: Great time to introduce you to modular arithmetic and the modulus operator `%`.
	- 4.35: Great introduction to converting mathematical formulas and proofs into actual code.
- Chapter 5
	- 5.22: Great way to expose/refresh you to De Morgan's Laws. Very useful for simplifying conditional expressions.
- Chapter 6
	- 6.38 -> 6.39: Great problem for implementing a recursive algorithm, and converting it to an iterative solution. You will solve the classic Towers of Hanoi problem, which is practically a right-of-passage for computer scientists.

When working through the exercises, don't spend too much time being stumped. If you can't figure out what to do after an hour, skip it and move on until I'm around to help you.
